## 🚀 About the Project

This repository is part of the **updated React + Next.js 2025 course** by **Luíz Otávio Miranda**.  
It focuses on building a complete **Pomodoro Timer**, applying modern **React 19 concepts**, component architecture, and software engineering best practices.

The app uses **Vite** for fast development, **TypeScript** for static typing, and **React Router** for navigation.  
It also uses **Web Workers** to handle time counting in the background without blocking the UI.

## 🧠 Personal Notes

This project marks the start of my journey through the **React & Next.js 2025 course**, reinforcing core concepts of frontend architecture, state management, and modern web development.

> “Mastering React is not about memorizing hooks — it’s about understanding **architecture, state, and component responsibility**.”

---

## 🌟 Ideas for Next Steps / Enhancements

- Add dark mode with persisted user preference
- Integrate notifications / sound alerts for session end
- Add statistics dashboard for session history and streaks
- Add tests for timer logic and context (unit + integration)
- Migrate part of the app to Next.js pages or app router as an exercise
